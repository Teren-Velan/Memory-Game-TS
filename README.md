<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of building a game using typescript and react , is to practice logical thinking skills. Building a game requires various problem solving skills from listing down the steps in sudo code , to coding out the functionalities and down to refactoring and testing those functionalities.

Using typescript to build this project, i took this opportunity to improve my typescript skills , ensuring to the best of my abilities to type all values and functionalities. 

A good way to also practice grid and transation animations
